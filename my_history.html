                        Besides the normal study trajectory of primary school, highschool, university I have attended a couple different activities. 
                        The reason behind this was to explore, have fun, get into contact with people from all over the world and develop myself on different levels. 
                        <h4>Vacational studies</h4>

                                Vacational studies is a month long summer course for kids ages 10-18 in Newbury, Berkshire, UK.
                                The owner and organizer has been running this concept since 1973.
                                It is a place to develop yourself, start mastering the English language, play a lot of sports and most of all have a LOT of fun with your new friends from all over the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The timetable for weekdays is classes in the morning, sports and other activities in the afternoon.
                                After diner there would usually be an event or free time where you could have a calm and quiet night or find yourself in an intense impromptu volleyball tournement with hot chocolate after.
                                Every now and then there would be an optional trip during the week this would usually be for muscials in London.
                                In the weekend you would usually have 1 or 2 daytrips. Usually to London but occasionally somewhere else.
                                During my time there I went on as many trips as possible. I have gone to multiple musicals and museums, an air show, been inside Buckingham Palace, Oxford and the list goes on.
