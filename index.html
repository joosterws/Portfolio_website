                        I am a student at the Hogeschool Utrecht Open-ICT.
                        My prefered style of learning is by experimenting and doing. 
                        I try to prevent doing repetitive work wherever I can since it is one of my biggest demotivator.

                        Since I was a child I have taken appart and put together devices and had an intense interest in how things worked.
                        Later this grew from understanding how things worked into wanting to create things.
                        Whenever something broke I would try to fix it myself (with a high succes rate).
                        As I grew older my projects became more advanced. I built my own computers and servers.
                        I started transitioning from only hardware to software aswell.
