                        Currently the hardware used is all old hardware used for old computer builds.
                        I am planning on upgrading it to more efficient and faster components.

                    <h3>The software</h3>
                    <div class="article-text">
                        UNRAID is an operating system that is designed to run on bare hardware, this is how I run it. 
                        It is best to not run this in a VM but it is possible.
                        UNRAID boots of a USB drive but once loaded runs off of the RAM.
                    </div>
                    <h3>What I use it for:</h3>
                    <div class="article-text">
                        <h4>Network Attached Storage</h4>
                        The primary use of my UNRAID machine is being a NAS. 
                        Since picture and video quality is getting better every year the file sizes have been growing just as fast. 
                        Increased file sizes, unloading the storage from my main systems and a fear of losing files when a drive fails made me build the NAS.
                        This allows me to still move files to it from my main system just like you would on any normal folder. It also allows any other system on the local network once logged in to acces files.

                        <h4>Docker</h4>
                        I run a lot of docker containers for ease of use. A couple examples and their use cases:
                        <div class="dashed_items">- NGINX and nginx proxy manager (NPM)</div> 
                        To host this and some other websites I use nginx. To send visitors to the correct website and docker container I use NPM to route the incomming traffic. Inside NPM you can add domains and the location they need to point to, like a local IP and port.
                        <div class="dashed_items">- Cloudflare tunnel</div> 
                        To make sure there is a secure connectiong without portforwarding I use a Cloudflare tunnel. 
                        This will send users that navigate to this website to my UNRAID box where NPM will send it to the correct container.
                        <div class="dashed_items">- Nextcloud</div> 
                        My Nextcloud also runs in docker. You can read more about this on the dedicated page for Nextcloud.
                        <div class="dashed_items">-Game servers</div> 
                        For the occasional time my friends would like to play a multiplayer game in a private enviroment I host them and many of them through Docker.
                        To allow people from anywhere to access my servers I route it via cloudflare DNS pointing it towards a DDNS that points to my home IP adress. The SRV record including the appropriate port points towards the CNAME record which points towards the DDNS.
                        
                        <h4>Virtual Machines</h4>
                        I used to have a couple Linux VMs with Ubuntu and other Distros setup. Since this I moved those to dedicated machines to give all machines more performance.
                        Currently the only VM is for HomeAssitant OS. This is because this will allow for all the HomeAssistant features in one central place without additional docker containers.
                        <P>If you want to read more about the benefits of HA OS instead of a docker container I recommend reading this: <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/"> HA installations</a>.</P>
